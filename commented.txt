React is the most popular javascript library.
Used by netflix and Instagram.
React is a library,not a framework.
React uses the React virtual DOM.
React firs creates the exact copy of the DOM.
Then figure out hich part is new and only updates that specific part in virtual DOM.
Finally, React copies the only new parts of virtual DOM.

JSX will be translated into normal javascript bu Babel.

Some Important rules of JSX.
1. We can't return moer than one HTML once.
2. We can use JSX inside for loop,if-else,cases.
3. HTML attribute names like "class" becomes "className".
4. HTML tags must alwas be closed.

React has two types of components :
1.Functional : These are stateless component and return react component.
Eg : function Welcome(props){
        return <h1>Welcome{props.name}</h1>
}
Eg : function Example(){
    return(<h1>I'am a functional component</h1>)
}

Eg : const Example = ()=>{
    return(<h1>I'am a functional componen</h1>)
}

2.Class : They are more complex than functional components including constructors.
Eg : class ExampleComponent extends component{
        render(){
                return(
                        <h1>I'am a functional componen</h1>
                );
        }
}
